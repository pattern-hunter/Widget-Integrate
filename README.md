Widget-Integrate
================

When you're writing a piece of software using Tkinter, you have to do a lot of trial and error to find a suitable position for each widget and the respective relative X and Y coordinates. This code will let you dynamically adjust the widgets so that you don't have to stop the running program to readjust the widget. Neat, huh?
